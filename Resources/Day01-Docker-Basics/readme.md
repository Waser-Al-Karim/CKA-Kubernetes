Containers are lightweight, portable environments that share the host OS kernel.

Virtual Machines are full-fledged virtualized systems with their own OS.

## When to Use What?

* Containers:
    * Ideal for lightweight and scalable application deployment.
    * Best for microservices and environments where portability is key.
    * Faster startup times and lower overhead.

* Virtual Machines
    * Suitable when running applications that require different operating systems.
    * Ideal for legacy applications or environments demanding high security and isolation.
    * Provides complete OS-level support.
