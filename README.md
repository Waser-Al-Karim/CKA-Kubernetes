## Day 01 Learnings: Docker Basics

* Docker runs applications in isolated containers.
* Containers are lightweight and share the host OS kernel.
* Virtual Machines (VMs) are heavier with full OS-level isolation.
* Dockerfile defines instructions to build container images.
* Docker architecture includes Engine, Images, Containers, and Registry.
* Containers are ideal for scalable, fast, and resource-efficient deployments.
